# Soccer Match Today Singapore
  
It's normal to put the pressure on in this game. But we talked within the team that we couldn't stay down, we had to get up quickly. and get back to concentrating on this game again As the time periods are quite close together, there's no time to be disappointed. We have to concentrate and do our best to win."

With a capacity of more than 55,000 spectators, the National Stadium is home to prestigious sporting events and large-scale entertainment. Its distinctive design, marked by a unique and bold dome, stands out in the city skyline and symbolizes the modernity and innovation that characterize Singapore.
 
The stadium was designed with versatility in mind, being able to host a variety of events, from soccer matches and international sports competitions to world-class concerts and shows. It is the only one in the world to encompass a special design for soccer, rugby, cricket and athletics events. The retractable dome is a notable feature, allowing the space to be adapted for different purposes and weather conditions, providing a comfortable experience for spectators.
 
In addition to its impressive facilities, the Singapore National Stadium incorporates sustainable and ecological technologies, reflecting the country's commitment to environmental responsibility. The areas around the stadium have also been designed to offer a complete experience, with commercial facilities, green spaces and amenities that complement the venue's vibrant atmosphere.
 
The venue is home to the Singapore national soccer team, the Singapore national cricket team and the Sunwolves, a Super Rugby team. It has also hosted a number of international events, including the 2015 Southeast Asian Games, the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the 2022 AFC Champions League final.

About 680 suspicious matches including qualifying games for the World Cup and European Championships, and the Champions League for top European club sides, have been identified in an inquiry by European police forces, the European anti-crime agency Europol and national prosecutors.
 
German soccer has been tarnished by match-fixing scandals in the past decade, one involving a corrupt referee who was caught, but German Football League (DFL) president Reinhard Rauball said the top two Bundesliga divisions were not caught up in this investigation.
 
Yet for me, like so many Singaporean children growing up in the 1970s, our lives revolved around soccer. I started playing soccer at age five and continue to play the game today with my colleagues at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at the Nanyang Technological University. Back in the 1970s, soccer enabled me to understand my neighbors and society better. Now, it not only keeps me fit but is an important part of my social interaction with my office colleagues.
 
In the 1970s, the medium of soccer allowed me to form strong social bonds with Singaporeans of other races and religions. This is still the case today, however, with one difference. The university is a microcosm of what Singapore society is now becoming. With large waves of migration over the last fifteen years, Singapore is once again an immigrant society, and soccer matches are an opportunity for me to get to know my colleagues, many of whom are new immigrants, and find out how they are adapting to the Singapore way of life. Considering the importance of soccer to people living in Japan, Korea, China, and the countries of Southeast Asia, it is surprising to me why so few Asian Studies scholars study sports in Asia, considering its usefulness as a topic of academic research. Studying soccer in Asia can provide insights into cultural, historical, political, and social processes whose ramifications go beyond the sporting arena.
 
More importantly, soccer at the grassroots or community level can provide a useful way of creating an environment where people can come together to show respect for others and share the common space. Indeed, this was my experience growing up in Singapore in the 1970s.
 
I grew up in a housing estate built in 1960 for civil servants. My abiding memory was the playground in the middle of Windsor Park housing estate where children of all races would meet regularly for a game of soccer. Windsor Park was a cross-section of Singapore society. The smaller houses closer to Upper Thomson Road housed clerks and lower-ranked civil servants. The semidetached homes were I lived were owned by middle-management civil servants. Up at the top of Windsor Park Hill was where people in top leadership positions in the Singapore Civil Service lived, like the late Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin. There was no sense of elitism among young people in those days. Elite schools, the gifted education program, or streaming that shape the attitudes of young people today did not exist. Then, we all were relatively equal. Children got along well and, invariably, soccer was the bridge.
 
Soccer broke down barriers created by race, ethnicity, class, and educational status. I began to realize that it was more than a game and could do more than just provide dirty laundry (which was always a source of consternation for my poor mother during the rainy season). During the school term, we would play soccer in the evenings. School holidays were memorable because we would play all day, every day. The match would start at nine in the morning and last until seven in the evening. Players joined in as and when they liked. There were no other distractions. For those of us privileged enough to own a television set, soccer on Radio and Television Singapore (RTS) was limited to a thirty-minute soccer program from the United Kingdom called Star Soccer, screened on Sundays. With an acute shortage of soccer on television, my life revolved around that playground in Windsor Park.
 
We did not play with a referee, so disputes would break out whenever there were objections over foul play or the legitimacy of a goal. Yet, rather than deepening racial divides, the need to negotiate and find an amicable solution to any dispute on the soccer field with a person of another race gave me deeper insights into secrets of developing solid intercultural relationships. In the course of play, you begin to understand how youth of different racial backgrounds respond to stressful situations. Over time, you learn to adapt and develop greater tolerance for each other. This allowed us to develop not only empathy, but also our own system of fair play, which meant that we did not require the presence of a referee as an arbiter. I have no doubt that my interaction with Chinese, Malay, and Eurasian Singaporeans on the soccer field laid the groundwork for my Singaporean identity. For many of my neighbors, the experience of playing in a diverse soccer setting also led them to become comfortable playing with others whose backgrounds may not resemble their own.
 
In fact, soccer in the late 1960s and early 1970s was very much a part of national life. People had a good balance between work and soccer. Employers such as government agencies the police, prisons, the postal service, National Electricity Board, customs, and port authorities all supported soccer, and the national team drew its players from the civil service.3 In the 1970s, government institutions would regularly organize interservice games to foster better understanding and closer cooperation among their employees. The Singapore Combined Secondary Schools Sports Council would regularly recommend a multiracial pool of school talent that the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) would channel to its various club affiliates to be nurtured into good soccer players.
 
What I have learned through the experience of playing soccer in a multiethnic environment is that while politics may provide the framework for integration, the rest has to come from the individuals themselves.Soccer captivates people from all cultural and social backgrounds, and growing up in post-Independence Singapore, it represented a connecting element for Singaporean society transcending ethnic divides.Adults can learn a lot from how children interact with each other. Unless influenced by the biases of adults, children do not distinguish between ethnicities. They approach each other as human beings and, in my own personal experience, as young people who have fun playing soccer. By exposing a child to soccer in parallel societies that exist within his or her home environment, we can promote integration amongst future generations.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of 3 post-match recovery modalities on physical performance, physiological measures, and players' perceptions of recovery after 90-minute soccer match play. On separate days, 28 young (age: 14.3 +/- 0.7 years) soccer players played 3 soccer matches each randomly followed by 1 of 3 recovery modalities: (a) CONT-cold (12 degrees C) water immersion and hot (38 degrees C) shower, (b) COMB-cold water immersion and active recovery using a cycle ergometer, and (c) PASS-a passive post-match routine (stretching and leg raise). Performance (vertical jump height), physiological (heart rate and tympanic temperature), and perceptual measures (perceived quality of recovery) were determined before each match, 10 minutes after each match, after each recovery method, and after 24 hours. There was a 0.6 +/- 6.7% drop in immediately after a match, but there was no difference in vertical jump height after 24 hours (p = 0.997). Perceived quality of recovery immediately after COMB was substantially higher than CONT and PASS, but the effect did not last more than 24 hours. The players perceived lighter legs after COMB, compared with the PASS, at post-24 hours. In conclusion, a combined recovery modality (cold water immersion and active recovery) after a soccer match did not have a substantial effect on vertical jump height performance when compared with contrast water immersion and passive recovery alone. However, the observed positive effects on perceived recovery (higher quality of recovery and lighter legs) after the combined modality (cold water immersion and active recovery) suggest that this approach may be effective for young players after intense soccer match play.
